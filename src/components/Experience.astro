                    At Fintiba it is my job to develop and maintain the
                    insurance products. This includes customer facing code,
                    internal tools (mainly functions for the internal customer
                    manager) as well as developing and integrating interfaces
                    with our insurance partners. Thousands of customers as well
                    as coworkers hence depend on the code written by me to be
                    correct and working. Concise, readable and correct code is
                    of the essence, to keep the customers and customer support
                    agents happy.
