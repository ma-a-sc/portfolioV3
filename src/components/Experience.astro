                    At this job I am responsible for code related to the
                    provided insurance products. This means customer facing
                    code, internal tools (mainly functions for the internal
                    customer manager) as well as interfacing code with the
                    insurance partners. Thousands of customers as well as
                    coworkers hence depend on the code being written by Me.
                    Concise, readable and correct code hence is of the essence,
                    because the customers rely on me to get their Visa for
                    studying or working in Germany.
